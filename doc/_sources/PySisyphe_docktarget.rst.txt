Target/Trajectory tab of the dock
=================================

- :ref:`target-section-target-list`
- :ref:`target-section-target-item`

Target/trajectory tools are displayed only in orthogonal view widget.

This dock shows a Target/trajectory list frame.

.. _target-section-target-list:
Target/Trajectory list
----------------------

Left-click to select a target or a trajectory element in the list (blue outline in Windows platform, blue background in MasOS platform).

|open|
	Left-click to show a Target/Trajectory selection dialog (PySisyphe XTOOLS file, xml format), adds selected Target(s)/Trajectory(ies) to the list and displays them in the orthogonal view widget.

|target|
	Left-click to show a dialog box to add a new Target. This dialog allows you to set the target position in 4 different ways:

	- **Cursor position**, check this option to set the target at the cursor position of the view widget.
	- **Absolute position**, check this option to set the target at the worlds coordinates (RAS+ convention, in mm) defined in the three edit boxes **X**, **Y** and **Z**. The default coordinates are set to the center of the field of view.
	- **Weighted position**, Check this option to set the target to the weighted barycenter of, at least, two Targets/Trajectoryies. 

		A table, below the **Weighted position** check box, lists the available Target(s)/trajectory(ies). A relative weight can be edited for each Target/Trajectory in the second column of the table. Absolute weights in the third column (i.e. sum of absolute weights equal to 1.0) cannot be modified, but are automatically updated when the relative weight of a Target/Trajectory is modified.

		The new target at the weighted barycenter is locked by default. Its position is automatically updated when an associated weighted Target/Trajectory is interactively moved by the user, as long as it remains locked.

	- **Relative position**, check this option to set the target relative to another Target/Trajectory used as a reference. 

		A combobox, below the **Relative position** check box, lists the available Target(s)/trajectory(ies) and is used to select one of them as a reference. 

		In each axis, the calculation involves absolute translation in mm relative to the reference Target/Trajectory and, optionally, an absolute multiplicative factor of the distance between two further Targets/Trajectories: <New target> = <Reference target> + <Translation> + <Factor> x euclidean distance(<target#1>, <target#2>). This formula is used in each direction **Antero-posterior** (y-axis), **Laterally** (x-axis) and **Height** (z-axis). 

		The first edit box is the <Translation> parameter, the second edit box is the <Factor> parameter and the two lastest, with available Targets/Trajectories, are the <target#1> and <target#2> parameters. The result of the formula, giving absolute translation in each direction, is displayed in the fifth edit box. The new target is locked by default. Its position is automatically updated when the reference Target/Trajectory is interactively moved by the user, as long as it remains locked.

	Click **OK** to validate position and display the new Target in the view widget.

|line|
	Left-click to show a dialog box to add a new Trajectory. This dialog allows you to set the target and entry positions of the trajectory:

	- The **Cursor position**, **Absolute position**, **Weighted position**, **Relative position** options for defining the target position of the trajectory are identical to those described above in |target|.
	- The entry position can be defined by a **trajectory** with two angles in degrees and a length in mm, or by an **absolute position** with three coordinates in **X**, **Y** and **Z** axes.

	Click **OK** to validate positions and display the new Trajectory in the view widget.

|save|
	Left-click show a dialog box to save all Target(s)/Trajectory(ies) of the list in a PySisyphe XTOOLS file (xml format).

|delete|
	Left-click to remove all Target(s)/Trajectory(ies) from the list and from the view widget.

|cross|
	Left-click to remove checked Target(s)/Trajectory(ies) from the list and from the view widget.

|check|
	Left-click to check all Target(s)/Trajectory(ies) of the list.

|uncheck|
	Left-click to uncheck all Target(s)/Trajectory(ies) of the list.

|duplicate|
	Left-click to add a copy of the selected Target/Trajectory in the list.

|toolfeature|
	Left-click to show a dialog of Target(s)/Trajectory(ies) features. This dialog have two tables **Coordinates** and **distances**.

	The first table shows coordinates of each Target/Trajectory in various reference systems:

	- **World coordinates**, x, y, z coordinates in mm, RAS+ convention. 
	- **Image coordinates**, x, y, z matrix indices
	- **Leksell**, x, y, z Leksell stereotactic coordinates in lateral-right convention.
	- **AC**, x, y, z relative to anterior commissure coordinates.
	- **PC**, x, y, z relative to posterior commissure coordinates.
	- **Mid AC-PC**, x, y, z relative to mid AC-PC coordinates.
	- **Lenght**, trajectory length in mm (Empty for Target).
	- **Sagittal angle**, sagittal angle of the trajectory around the x-axis in degrees (Empty for Target).
	- **Coronale angle**, coronal angle of the trajectory around the y-axis in degrees (Empty for Target).

	The second table shows the distances between all Target(s)/Trajectory(ies) of the list.

	Two buttons are avalaible at the bottom:

	- **Copy to screenshots**, to take a bitmap capture of the displayed table and copy it to the :ref:`Screenshots manager <page-screenshots>`.
	- **Save dataset**, show a dialog box to save the displayed table (supported formats CSV, JSON, Latex, TEXT, Excel XLSX, Pysisyphe XSHEET)

|toolfeature2|
	Left-click to show a dialog of distances between Target(s)/Trajectory(ies) and mesh(es). This dialog have three tables:

	- **Inside mesh**, True if Target/Trajectory coordinate is inside mesh.
	- **Distance to mesh surface**, euclidean distance between the Target/Trajectory and the nearest point of the mesh surface.
	- **Distance to mesh center of mass**, eucliddistance distance between the Target/Trajectory and the mesh center of mass.

	Two buttons are avalaible at the bottom:

	- **Copy to screenshots**, to take a bitmap capture of the displayed table and copy it to the :ref:`Screenshots manager <page-screenshots>`.
	- **Save dataset**, show a dialog box to save the displayed table (supported formats CSV, JSON, Latex, TEXT, Excel XLSX, Pysisyphe XSHEET)
