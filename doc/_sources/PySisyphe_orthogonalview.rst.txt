This widget, placed in the central area, displays 2D synchronized orthogonal slices of a reference volume in three cells (axial top-right cell, coronal bottom-left cell, sagittal bottom-right cell), and a synchronized 3D volume renderer in the top-left cell.

Other volume(s) can overlay the reference (popup menu "Display as overlay" of one or more thumbnail volumes). It can display meshes, trajectory/target tools and streamlines (:ref:`Mesh <page-dockmesh>`, :ref:`Target/Trajectory <page-docktarget>`, :ref:`Tracking <page-docktracking>`), but it does not manage ROI (:ref:`ROI <page-dockroi>`, :ref:`ROI Tools <page-dockroitools>`).

Left-click to select a grid cell. Some controls can be applied only to a selected cell. This cell is outlined in white.

.. _ortho-section-transfer-function-widget:
Transfer function widget
------------------------

.. image:: /GUI/transfer-function.png
   :align: center
|
The transfer function is used for texture rendering of the reference volume. The purpose of a transfer function is to associate a color and opacity with each scalar value of the volume.

The transfer widget displays a brown line that is the transfer function. This line is initially drawn between two points, which are displayed as circles at either end. Each point has a color, drawn inside circle, and opacity is represented by the height in the vertical axis of the point's position (0.0 i.e. transparent, if the point is in the widget's lower border; 1.0 i.e. opaque, if the point is in the widget's upper border). The scalar value and the opacity values are displayed above each point.

Double-click in the free widget area to add a new point. The line is drawn between the points, which represents the linear interpolation of opacity and color values between transfer function points. Press left mouse button and drag to move a point.

Right-click on a point to show popup menu:

- **Remove point**, to remove the current point from the transfer function line.
- **Clear all**, to remove all points except ends.
- **Save...**, to save the current transfer function.
- **Load...**, to load a transfer function.

Right-click in the free widget area shows the same popup menu with the exception of the following item:
- **Add new** to add a new point to the transfer function line.

The second transfer widget is similar, but works with the gradient magnitude of the volume (not scalar values of the volume). It is optional, unckeck "Gradient transfer function" to ignore this tranfer function. It is interesting to improve the rendering of object edges, since high gradient values in edges are associated with high alpha.

.. image:: /GUI/transfer-lut.png
   :align: center
|
The last widget defines the color part of the transfer function. The background of the widget shows the colormap. Initially, only two color points are defined, displayed as triangles on the left and right edges.

Double-click in the free widget area add a new color point. Press left mouse button and drag to move a color point.

Right-click on a point to show popup menu:

- **Remove point**, remove the current color point.
- **Change point color**, change the color of the current point (displays a dialog box for color selection).
- **Swap color with next point**, swap the color between the current point and the next.
- **Swap color with previous point**, swap the color between the current point and the previous.
- **Clear all**, to clear all the points except ends.
- **Save...**, to save the current color transfer function.
- **Load...**, to load the current color transfer function.

Two buttons are available on the bottom:

- **Open**, open transfer functions (scalar, gradient and color)
- **Save**, save the transfer functions (scalar, gradient and color)
