|magic|
	Click to display a menu with two segmentation algorithms:

	- **Region growing**, select and left-click in the view widget to calculate the region growing from the clicked seed voxel (see `SimpleITK ConnectedThresholdImageFilter class <https://simpleitk.org/doxygen/v2_5/html/classitk_1_1simple_1_1ConnectedThresholdImageFilter.html>`_).

Parameters used by this algorithm are defined in :ref:`tools-section-brush-settings`.
	- **Active contour**, select and left-click in the view widget to calculate the active contour from the clicked seed voxel. Parameters used by this algorithm are defined in the next menu **Active contour settings...**
	- **Active Contour Settings...**, select to display a settings dialog box. Active contour level set method (also known as snake) segments structures in images based on a user supplied edge potential map. An initial contour is itertively propagated outwards (or inwards) until it "sticks" to the shape boundaries. This is done by using a level set speed function based on a user supplied edge potential map. This map has values close to zero in regions near edges and values close to one in regions with relatively constant intensity. Typically, the edge potential map is a function of the gradient magnitude.
	
		- **Level set algorithm**, Three active contour algorithms are available: original geodesic active contour, shape detection and threshold variants (see `SimpleITK GeodesicActiveContourLevelSetImageFilter class <https://simpleitk.org/doxygen/v2_5/html/classitk_1_1simple_1_1GeodesicActiveContourLevelSetImageFilter.html>`_, `ShapeDetectionLevelSetImageFilter class <https://simpleitk.org/doxygen/v2_5/html/classitk_1_1simple_1_1ShapeDetectionLevelSetImageFilter.html>`_, `ThresholdSegmentationLevelSetImageFilter class <https://simpleitk.org/doxygen/v2_5/html/classitk_1_1simple_1_1ThresholdSegmentationLevelSetImageFilter.html>`_). The threshold variant algorithm used thresholds defined in |threshold|.
		- **Seed radius**, radius en mm of the seed sphere centered used as initial contour (default 2.0 mm).
		- **Curvature weight**, curvature (default relative weight 1.0), controls the magnitude of the curvature values which are calculated on the evolving isophote. This is important in controlling the relative effect of curvature in the calculation. Higher values relative to the other level set equation terms (propagation and advection) will give a smoother result.
		- **Propagation weight**, propagation speed (default relative weight 1.0) controls the scaling of the scalar propagation (speed) term relative to other terms in the level set equation. Positive values propagate contour towards outside the seed, negative values inside.
		- **Advection weight**, advection (default relative weight 1.0) controls the scaling of the vector advection field term relative to other terms in the level set equation.
		- **RMS convergence threshold**, Convergence threshold (0.0 to 1.0, default 0.01) used to determine when the solution has converged. A lower value will result in a tighter-fitting solution, but will require more computations. Too low a value could put the solver into an infinite loop unless a reasonable number of iterations parameter is set.
		- **Number of iterations**, maximum number of iterations (default 1000) can be used to halt the solution after a specified number of iterations, overriding the rms halting criteria.
		- **Gaussian kernel sigma**, gaussian kernel sigma used to compute the magnitude of the gradient (default 1.0).
		- **Threshold factor**, Factor value x standard deviation of signal in seed sphere to estimate lower and upper thresholds used by threshold variant of the level set algorithm (default 3.0).

|statistics| button in the Volume Tools box activates this dialog.

The top of this dialog box is occupied by a tabbed stack widget of three charts:

**Histogram** (3)
	These are histogram(s) of the reference volume signal of voxels located in each ROI. The number of histogram bins i.e. intervals (default 100) can be changed in the **bins** combobox of the button bar. The line of each histogram has the color of the ROI associated with it.

**Cumulative histogram** (4)
	These are cumulative histogram(s) of the reference volume signal of voxels located in each ROI. The line of each histogram has the color of the ROI associated with it. This chart is interactive, the vertical dotted line (6) can be moved with the mouse (press left mouse button and drag). This line has the color of the selected ROI in the table and gives information (7) about it. Information to the right of the line includes: ROI name, signal value at line position, percentage of ROI volume with signal greater than current signal at line position, ROI volume (cc) with signal greater than current signal at line position.

**Box and Whisker plot** (5)
	This is a Box and Whisker plot (see `Box and Whisker plot in wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot>`_) of the reference volume signal of voxels located in each ROI.

There is another tabbed stack widget below with two tables:

	These tables gives descriptive statitics of the reference volume signal in each ROI. Table columns are: ROI name with check box, voxels (number of voxels), volume (cc), mean, median, minimum, maximum, range, 25th percentile, 75th percentile, variance, standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis.

**Shape features** (2)
	These tables gives shape features of each ROI (see `pyradiomics shape features <https://pyradiomics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features.html#module-radiomics.shape>`_). Table columns are: ROI name, volume (cc), surface, surface/volume ratio, sphericity, maximum diameter, maximum axial diameter, maximum coronal diameter, maximum sagittal diameter, major axis length, elongation, flatness.

Finally, there is a button bar at the bottom:

**Bins**
	Combobox to define histogram bins i.e. intervals (from 50 to 500).

**Save chart**
	Left-click displays a menu to save bitmap capture (supported bitmap formats BMP, JPG, PNG, TIFF and SVG) of chart(s):
