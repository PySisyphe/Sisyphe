.. _install-section-from-binary:
From binary installer
---------------------

Download the binary installer for MS Windows or MacOS Intel platforms from https://github.com/PySisyphe/Sisyphe.
There is no version for the Linux platform, as some of the modules required to run PySisyphe are not yet available on this operating system.

Additional content (templates, atlases, samples, various modality scans from volunteer groups...) can be retrieved directly from the download manager integrated into the PySisyphe interface (menu File -> Download manager...). 

.. _install-section-from-source:
From source
-----------

If you plan to develop plugins, you will need to install PySisyphe from source.

PySisyphe runs on Python version 3.10, download the last release with binary installer (3.10.11, release date: April 5, 2023) at https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-31011/, and install it.

We recommend working with the PyCharm IDE development environment (JetBrains Distributions s.r.o., Czech Republic), download community edition at https://www.jetbrains.com/fr-fr/pycharm/, and install it. Run PyCharm IDE and create a new project (menu File -> New project) with venv interpreter type and previously installed Python 3.10.11 version.

1. Download PySisyphe source at https://github.com/PySisyphe/Sisyphe ("<> Code" button, and select Download ZIP).
2. Unzip "Sisyphe-main.zip" archive.
3. Rename "Sisyphe-main" folder to "Sisyphe".
4. Copy "Sisyphe" folder in the PyCharm project folder.
5. Open the Pycharm terminal (ALT-F12), the current folder is by default the root of the project folder (a requirements.txt exists in this folder).
6. To install the python modules needed to work with PySisyphe, type at the command line: pip install -r requirements.txt

At this stage, all external and PySisyphe modules are installed for your own development.
PySisyphe core (Sisyphe.core.<module name>) and widget (Sisyphe.widgets.<module name>) modules can be imported with: 
 
- from Sisyphe.core.<module name> import * (to import all functions/classes of the Sisyphe.core.<module name>)
- from Sisyphe.core.<module name> import <function/class name> (to import the function/class <function/class name> of the Sisyphe.core.<module name>)

To run PySisyphe in PyCharm IDE:

1. Run PyCharm IDE, project will be opened by default.
2. Load PySisyphe.py if not already open (menu File -> Open...)
3. Run PySisyphe.py (menu Run -> Run 'PySisyphe', or ALT+F10)
